# Licensing

Quorum for Android is free software under the GNU General Public License, version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`, full text
in `LICENSE`).

- **The engine** (`engine/firmware/`) is Quorum's firmware, forked from
  [zeptosecond-dsp/Quorum](https://github.com/zeptosecond-dsp/Quorum); the Android changes in it (marked
  `QUORUM_ANDROID`) are Zeptosecond DSP's, written by machine (Claude, by Anthropic) with human guidance.
  Its authorship is as Quorum's own licensing notes give it, reproduced below.
- **The Android port** (`engine/android/`, `engine/tests/`, `engine/sync_from_quorum.sh`, `app/`, the build files) is
  by Zeptosecond DSP, written by machine (Claude, by Anthropic) with human guidance. `engine/android/android_platform.c`
  follows the shape of Dinghy's `tests/host.c` (zvenson).
- **Oboe** (Google), the audio library, is Apache-2.0, fetched at build time.

## Quorum's licensing notes

Quorum is free software under the GNU General Public License, version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`, full text in
`LICENSE`), as Dinghy, which it is built on. The app (`firmware/src/dinghy.c`, `ca_tables.h`, `q_tables.h`, `verb.h`,
`tunings.h`, `luts.h`, `font_chunky.h`), `tools/gen_ca_tables.py`, `tools/gen_tables.py`, `tools/gen_font8.py`,
`tools/preview_tables.py`, `tools/fm1_winmidi.py`, the host scripts in `tests/scripts/` and `docs/QUICKSTART.md` are by
Zeptosecond DSP, written by machine (Claude, by Anthropic) with human guidance; `verb.h` (the reverb), `tunings.h`,
`luts.h` and `wt_tables.h` come from its sister, [Arcturus S6](https://github.com/zeptosecond-dsp/Arcturus-S6). Everything else is Dinghy's, as below.

complete source under the same licence too.
